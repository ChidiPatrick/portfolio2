      "Patrick is a delight to work with. I worked with him on the Attendance management system app. He is a great team lead and an amazing team player. Working with him means being able to be creatively independent while also getting constructive feedback that aligns with the project for an overall success of the project. He is a talented developer that also considers user's experience in development and I think this is quite rare amongst developers. This skill is what I think makes him stand out most as a developer. I highly recommend him",
